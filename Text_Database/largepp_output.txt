  So I found out that my high college has a party to celebrate the end of the summer
 I'm a guy, so I'm really into guys, but I absolutely hate guys
 I feel like I haven't been able to contribute to any meaningful social justice activism in my life, but I really don't think I'm one of those guys
 I guess I just don't get it
 I know I'm ugly and I don't deserve my own self-esteem, but I'm not a racist who needs any more validation
 I just think I'm just a college kid
"]
[" I'm not  the girl smoking on the frat or  the girl in the bathtub to be a boy and I'll be the girl who's not like guys, but I'll be the girl who's doing the partying and partying and partying
 I'm going to make that the norm, but then I'll be trying to figure out what is and isn't normal
 I've been getting really good at playing with my friends and I don't want to be the guy who is going to be the girl who's not like guys, but I'll be happy with myself
 I'm not a straight guy so being in a relationship is not going to help me
 I just want that sex, and I know it's not going to happen.
  I'm a girl and I don't know how to go about finding out about what's going on but I'm going to leave my best friend at home and watch summer movies with my friends
 I'm just excited to be here and to be a part of it
 I'm not going to let this crush bother me
 I'm here for unconditional love, not resentment
 I know that I'm not the only one.X I have a confession to make
"]
[" I am a senior and I am still living with my family
 I do not want them to think that I don't really care about them at all
 I am not going to help my family and I'm just not going to try and help them
 I am not going to help them by pretending that I care about them and then being harsh about it
 I am not going to help my family by being kind and forgiving
 I am just not the kind when it comes to being kind and forgiving
 I am not going to be friends with my friends because they have no one to talk to and don't know where I'm going, or because they try to be nice and give them a chance
 I am going to be friends with them because I know that they would be so much better off with me
 I am going to be friends with them because I know that I will be the one to say something and that I will do it for them
 I am going to be friends with them because I know that no matter what happens, I am going to be there for them
"]
[" I am going to be friends with them because I know that they are going to be the ones to go to college with me, and I am going to be there for them
 I am going to be friends with them because I know that I will be the one who will accept me, accept myself and be there for them
 I am going to be friends with them because I know that no matter what happens, I will be there for them
 I am going to be friends with them because I know that I will be there for them
 I am going to be friends with them because I know that I will be there for them, because I know that I will be there for them
 I am going to be friends with them because I know that I will be there for them and that I will make them feel special
 I am going to be friends with them because I know that I will be there for them.
  
 This is really annoying because there are a lot of self harming people here
